## Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using a simple markdown-based blog system. The system is built with Node.js and processes markdown files to create a beautiful blog.

## Features

- Markdown support
- Front matter metadata
- Clean and responsive design
- Easy to maintain and update

## How to Write Posts

To create a new post, simply add a markdown file to the `posts` directory with the following format:

```markdown
---
title: Your Post Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: Your Name
excerpt: A brief description of your post
---

Your post content goes here...
```

Feel free to use any markdown features like:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- Lists
- Code blocks
- And more!

Happy blogging!
